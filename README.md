# calculator

This is a simple calculator web app that was created as part of The Odin Project (TOP) Foundations course.

## How to use

The calculator has numeric values `[0 - 9]`, operators `[+, -, x, /]`, and `[., =]`,  allowing you to build mathematical statements.

Each number should be followed by an operator, for example, `90 + 2` is a valid input, but `90 =` is not.
